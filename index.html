### Verification Steps
To confirm the CSS is working with the HTML:
1. **File Structure**: Place `index.html` and `styles.css` (from the previous response, artifact_id: `66e502c1-f236-4ad6-8923-7285cf0ababc`) in the same directory.
2. **Image Assets**: Ensure the image files (`logo.png`, `bitcoin.png`, `ethereum.png`, `solana.png`, `uniswap.png`, `opensea.png`) are in the same directory or update their paths in `index.html` if they’re in a subfolder.
3. **Test Locally**:
   - Open a terminal in the directory containing the files.
   - Run a local server: `python -m http.server 8000`.
   - Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
4. **Check Console**: Open the browser’s developer tools (F12 or right-click > Inspect) and check the Console tab for errors (e.g., “Failed to load resource: styles.css”).
5. **Clear Cache**: If styles still don’t apply, clear the browser cache or test in incognito mode.

### If You Meant Inline CSS
If you intended for the CSS to be embedded directly in the `index.html` file (instead of a separate `styles.css` file), I can provide an updated version with the CSS included in a `<style>` tag within the `<head>`. However, keeping CSS in a separate file is generally better for maintainability and performance. Please confirm if you want the CSS embedded in `index.html` instead, and I’ll provide that version.

### Additional Notes
- The `styles.css` file from the previous response (artifact_id: `66e502c1-f236-4ad6-8923-7285cf0ababc`) is designed to work with the provided `index.html`. It includes styles for the futuristic Web3 aesthetic, such as neon colors, glitch animations, and enhanced visibility for the Bitcoin image.
- The datetime in the header should now correctly display in EST (e.g., “Tuesday, August 19, 2025, 12:51:XX PM EDT”) and update every second, as implemented in the JavaScript.
- If you’re still experiencing issues, please share specific symptoms (e.g., which elements lack styling, any console errors) or confirm the file structure, and I’ll provide further tailored assistance.

Let me know if you need the CSS embedded in `index.html`, additional troubleshooting, or any other modifications!
